                    <p style = "text-align: left;">pitch is a wasp who, in the past, made his living as a performer. nowadays,
                        he does so as a thief. while these two professions may be worlds apart, the acrobatic skills he developed
                        back then have served his new life quite well. he may seem like a pretty laid-back guy, but with his expertise 
                        and his toothpick spear, he's not to be taken lightly.<br><br>
                        
                        after leaving his troupe, pitch has stuck to himself. others just get in the way, don't they? too many
                        variables, too many things that could go wrong, especially during a heist. despite this, (plus some initial resistance
                        on pitch's part) he's made an unlikely friendship with a bee named <a href = "cleft.html">cleft</a>.<br><br>

                        since then, not much has changed. to this day, pitch has never been caught, and cleft still doesn't know what
                        he actually does for work...
