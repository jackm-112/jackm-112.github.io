                <div class="divider">01: cool songs</div>
                <p>now that the site's been fully re-written, i thought it'd be fun to share some cool songs i've been listening to lately. keep in mind that i'm not a music
                reviewer by any means so don't be expecting in-depth write-ups.<br> <br>
                <a href = "https://open.spotify.com/track/50PqkVcHBP1zi3USIRtooK?si=d9195ca629454f8f">Chubby</a>
                <span style="color:gray"><small>Pitcher56 - Pitcher56 1st Album</small></span><br>
                after not putting out any new music in over a decade, Pitcher56 came back in 2022 with the (aptly..?)
                titled 'Pitcher56 1st Album' and this opening track is so good. the piano is my favourite instrument
                and it's difficult for me not to love songs that include it.<br><br>

                <a href = "https://open.spotify.com/track/1s16yZ0cyNAJJT1iUVMwam?si=3ce894e9cbc341a4">If You Want It</a>
                <span style="color:gray"><small>Niteflyte - Niteflyte</small></span><br>
                the guitar in the opening to this one seriously reminded me of 'Sparkle' by Tatsuro Yamashita, one of my
                all-time favourite songs + artists. if you can find an upload somewhere, i implore you to take a listen. as for 'If You Want It,'
                the strings are really nice and the vocals are just amazing. plus, the hook <cite>"if you want it, you can get it, with your love"</cite>
                is super catchy.<br><br>

                <a href = "https://open.spotify.com/track/2WxzLbJfPA2vJGxQiKd7Jq?si=8144865e71b0431e">Fine Whine (feat. Joe Fox, Future & M.I.A.)</a>
                <span style="color:gray"><small>A$AP Rocky - AT.LONG.LAST.A$AP</small></span><br>
                yet again, im a sucker for piano. i adore Rocky's experimental production, especially on his 2018 album 'TESTING.'
                i must've listened to this song on repeat a dozen times yesterday while drawing.<br><br>

                <a href = "https://open.spotify.com/track/50UymqLGnRL10EA2CttJh2?si=7d19ae285c824b02">Bubbles</a>
                <span style="color:gray"><small>jenny01 - jenny01 Best</small></span><br>
                this song shares a lot of vibes with 'Chubby.' 1:40 is incredible, especially with headphones on. very cheerful-sounding song
                all around. this is the type of music i'd like to make someday. :)

                <div class="divider">00: making a website</div>
                <p>the first (of likely many) blog posts! at the time of writing, the blog is still being implemented so i'm not sure when this'll go up.
                    making this website is a learning experience. <br> <br>for example, the way things work right now, the whole blog page format breaks depending
                    on the length of certain pieces of text. it's hard to describe properly. it's a miracle everything else (mostly) works lol
                </p>
                <p style="color:gray"><small>later...</small></p>
                <p>i figured out what's making everything break. no clue how to fix it though. basically, if a blog post doesn't have enough text to fill
                    its default width, (i.e. enough text so that it goes onto a second line) then it tries to cram two elements next to each other.</p>
